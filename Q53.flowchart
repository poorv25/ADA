Given two integers, a and b
Check if a is equal to b. If yes, return a as the GCD.
If a is greater than b, divide a by b and get the remainder. Set a to be the value of b and b to be the remainder.
If b is greater than a, divide b by a and get the remainder. Set b to be the value of a and a to be the remainder.
Recursively call the GCD function with the new values of a and b as parameters.
Continue until a and b are equal, then return a as the GCD.
