Start with two sorted arrays A and B
Set up a new array C to hold the merged elements of A and B
Find the midpoints of A and B
Recursively merge the left half of A with the left half of B
Recursively merge the right half of A with the right half of B
Merge the two halves obtained in steps 4 and 5 into the final sorted array C
