Initialize a set of visited vertices and a priority queue of edges.
Select an arbitrary vertex as the starting vertex and add it to the visited set.
For each adjacent edge of the starting vertex, add it to the priority queue.
While the priority queue is not empty:
  a. Remove the edge with the lowest weight from the priority queue.
  b. If both vertices of the edge are not visited, add the edge to the minimum spanning tree and mark the vertices as visited.
  c. For each adjacent edge of the newly added vertex, add it to the priority queue if the adjacent vertex is not visited.
Output the minimum spanning tree.
