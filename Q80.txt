START

Read the weight capacity of the knapsack (W) and the number of items (n)

Create an array of items with their weights (w) and values (v)

Calculate the value per unit weight (v/w) for each item

Sort the items in decreasing order of value per unit weight

Initialize the total value (V) and remaining capacity of the knapsack (R) to 0

FOR i = 1 to n:
    IF R + w[i] <= W:
        Add the entire item i to the knapsack
        V += v[i]
        R += w[i]
    ELSE:
        Add a fractional amount of item i to the knapsack
        V += (W - R) * (v[i] / w[i])
        R = W
        BREAK

Display the total value (V) of the items in the knapsack
